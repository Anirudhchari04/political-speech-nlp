      "a year ago weere hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked denials for days weeks then months that led to more deaths more infections more stress and more loneliness photos and viteos from twenty nineteen feel like they were taken in another era. the last vacation the last birthday with friends the last holiday with the extended family while it was different for everyone we all lost something a collective suffering a collective sacrifice a year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us but in the loss. we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation respect and gratitude finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do in fact it may be the most american thing we do and that's what we've done we've seen front line and te central workers risking their lives sometimes losing them. to save and help others researchers and sciencists racing for a vaccine and so many of you as hemingway wrote being strong in all the broken places i know it's been hard i truly know as i've told you before i carry a card in my pocket. with the number of americans who have died from cova to dat is on the back of my schedule as of now total deaths in america five hundred and twenty seven thousand seven hundred and twenty six that's more deaths than in war war one warl war two the via nom. and nine eleven combined there were husbands wives sons and daughters grandparents friends neighbors young and old they leave behind love ones unable to truly grieve or to heal even to have a funeral but i'm also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural cause. by cruel fate of accident or other disease they too died alone they too leave behind love ones who are hurting badly you know you've often heard me say before i talk about the longest walk any parent can make as up a short flight of stairs to as child's bedroom to say iam sorry. but lost my job can't be here any more like my dad told me when he lost his job in scranton so many of youave had to make that same walk this past year you lost your job you closed your business facing aviction homelessness hunger a loss of control. maybe worst of all a loss of hope watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more because they have not been in school because of their loss of learning it's the details of life that matters most and we miss those details the big details in the small moments weddings birth. ays graduations all the things that needed to happen but didn't the first date the family reunions the sunday night rituals it's all  as exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us for we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others. a to laugh to hug to hold one another but this virus has kept us apart and grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren parents haven't seen their kids kids haven't seen their friends the things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become things we couldn't do. and broke our hearts too often we've turned against one another a mask the easiest thing to do to save lives sometimes it divides us states pitted against one another instead of working with each other vicious hate crimes against asian americans who been attacked. harassed blamed and scapegoaded at this very moment so many of them are fellow americans they're on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives and still still they're forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in america it's wrong it's an american and it must. stop look we know what we need to do to beat this virus tell the truth follow the scientists the science work together put trust and faith in our government to fulfil its most important function which is protecting the american people no function more important we need to remember the government isnint. foreign force in a distant capital no it's us all of us we the people for you and i that america thrives when we give our hearts we may turn our hands so common purpose and right now my friends we're doing just thati. say as your present i am grateful to you last summer i was in philadelphia and i met a small business owner a woman i asked her i said what do you need most never forget what she said to me she said and looking me in the eyes she said i just want the truth the truth just tell me the. uth think of that my fellow americans you owe nothing less than the truth and for all of you asking when things will get back to normal here is the truth the only way to get our lives back to get our economy back on tract is to beat the virus you've been hearing. say that for while i was running and the last fifty days i've been president but this is one of the most complex operations we've underernd  ever undertaken as a nation and a long time that's why i'm using every power i have as president of the united states to put us on a war footing to get the job done sounds like hyperbole but i mean it a war footing. and thank god we're making some real progress now and my first full day in office i outline for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic we have spent every day since attempting to carry it out two months ago the country this country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or ever near all. american public but soon we will we've been working with vaccine manufacturers fizer madurna johnson and johnson to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe effective vaccines and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration johnson and johnson. is working together with a competitor murke to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new johnson and johnson vacime whichs one shot in fact just yesterday i announced and i met with the c  os of both companies i announced our plan to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and. an vaccins these two companies competitors have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it it's truly a national effort just like we saw during war war too now because all the work we've done we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of. that's months ahead of schedule and we're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm calling active duty military fima retired doctors and nurses administrators and those to administer the shots and we've been creating more places to get the shots. 've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one any one of ten thousand pharmacies across the country just like you get your flue shot we're also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly six hundred federally supported vaccination centers that administers hundreds of thousands of shots per da. you can drive up to a statem or a large parking lot get your shot never leave your car and drive home in less than an hourwe've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across america located in underserved areas and we've been deploring and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop up clinics to meetou. where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it we continue to work on making at home testing available and we've been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic black latino native american and rural communities so what does all this add up to when i took office fifty days ago. only eight per cent of the americans after months only eight per cent of those over the age of sixty five had gotten their first vaccination to day that number is sixty five per cent just fourteen per cent of americans over the age of seventy five fifty fifty days ago had gotten their first shot to day that number is. over seventy per cent with new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention the c d c that came out on monday it means simply this millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so and the more people are fully vaccinated the c d will continue to provide additional guidance. and what you can do in the work place places of worship with your friends as well as travel when i came into office you may recall i said a goal that many of you said was a kind of way over the top i said i intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office to night i can say we're. a going to meet that goal we're going to beat that goal because we've actually on track to reach this goal of a hundred million shots and arms on my sixtieth day in office no other country in the world has done this none i want to talk about the next steps we're thinking about first to night i'm announcing that i will direct all states tribes and territory. to make all adults people eighteen and over eligible to be vaccinated no later than may one let me say that again all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may one that's much earlier than expected let me be clear that doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately. it means you'll be able to get in line beginning may one every adult will eligiblo get their shot and to do this we're going to go from a million shots a day that i promised in december before i  sworn in to maintaining beating our current pace of two million shots a day outpacing the rest of the world secondly at. time when every adult is eligible to may we will launch with our partners new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot including a new web site that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you no more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. thirdly with the passage of the american rescue plant and i thank again the house and senat for passing it and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff including bus drivers we can accelerate massive nation wide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal that. stated at the same time about a hundred million shots of opening a majority of k through eight schools in my first hundred days in office this is going to be the number one priority of my new secretary of education miguel cardona fourth in the coming weeks we will issue further guidance. on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated to lessen the confusion to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinated and finally fifth and maybe most importantly i promise i will do everything in my power i will not relent until we beat this fires but i need you. the american people i need you i need every american to do their part that's not hyperbole i need you i need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family your friends your neighbors get vaccinated as well because here's the point if we do all this if we. do our part if we do this together by july the fourth there's a good chance you your families and friends we'll be able to get together in your back yard or in your neighbourhood and have a cook out in a barbecue and celebrate independence day that doesn't mean large events with lots of people together but it does mean small groups we'll be able to get together after this long hard. year that will make this independence day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus but to get there we can't let our guard down this fight is far from order from over as i told the woman of pennsylvania i'll. you the truth july fourth with your loved ones is the goal but a goal a lot can happen conditions can change the scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread and we've got work to do to insure that everyone has confidence. the safety and effect of all three vaccinesso my message to you is this listen to doctor fouche one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world he's assured us the vaccines are safe they underwent rigorous scientific review i know they're safe vice president harri harris and i know they're safe. that's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so for the world to see so you cand see us do it the first lady and the second gentleman also got vaccinated talk to your family friends your neighbors the people you know best who've gotten the vaccine we need every one to get vaccinated we need every one to keep washing their. ands stay socially distance and keep wearing the mask as recommended by the c d c because even if we devote every resource we have beating thes fires and getting back to normal depends on national unity ad national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in washington or what the loudest. s sand cable or on line unity is what we do together as fellow americans because we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track and please we don't want to do that again we've made so much progress this is not the time to let up. just as we were emerging from te dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules i'll close with this we've lost so much over the last year we've lost family and friends we've lost business and dreams we spent years building. we've lost time time with each other and our children have lost so much time with their friends time with their schools no graduation ceremonies tisays spring no graduations from college high school moving up ceremonies you know there's something else we lost we lost faith in weather our government and our. democracy can deliver on really hard things for the american people but as i stand here to night we're proving once again something i've said time and time again till they' probably tired of hearg me say it i say it to foreign leaders and domestic alike it's never ever a good bet to bet against the american people amer. is coming back the development manufacture and distribution of vaccenes and record time is a true miracle of science it's one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished and we also just saw the perseverance rover land on mars stunning images of our dreams that are now reality. another example of the extraordinary american ingenuity commitment and belief in science and one another and to day i signed in te law of the american rescue plan an historic piece of legislation it delivers immediate relief to millions of people includes one thousand four hundred dollars in direct rescue checks payments that means. typical family of four earning about a hundred and ten thousand dollars will get checks for five thousand six hundred dollars deposited in te direct deposit or in a check a treasury check it extends unemployment benefits it helps small businesses the lowers health care premiums for many it provides food and nutrition keeps families in their homes and it will cut child poverty in this. ontry in half according to the experts and ifi it funds all the steps i've just described to beat the viris and create millions of jobs in the coming weeks and months i'll be travelling along with the first lady the vice president the second gentleman members of my cabinet to speak directly to you to tell you the truth. how the american rescue plan meets the moment and if it fails at any pace i will acknowledge tit has failed but it will not abut how after long dark years one whole year there is hope and light of better days ahead if we all do our part this country will be vaccinated soon our economy. be on the mend our kids will be back in schoolan we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything hard things big things important things over a year ago no one could have imagined what we were about to go through but now. we're coming through it and it's a shared experience that binds us together as a nation we are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us my fervent. prayer for our country that after all we've been through we'll come together as one people one nation one america i believe we can and we will we're seizing this moment and history i believe will record we faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation. history darkest we've ever known i promise you we'll come out stronger weth a renewed faith in ourselves a renewed commitment to one another to our communities and to our country this is the united states of america and there's nothing nothing from the botto of my heart i believe thas there's nothing we. do when we do it together so god bless you all and please god give solace to all those people who lost someone and may god protect our troops thank you for taking the time and listen i look forward to seeing you. . \n"
